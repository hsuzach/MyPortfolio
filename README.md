This assignment's goal was to use Bootstraps Grid System to create a mobile-responsive website.
I created a personal webpage with my portfolio and contact information.

I also utilized Bootstrap's NavBar and Card system to create a functional layout. 
At various breakpoints for screen width, the content should adjust its format to fit in the browser.
